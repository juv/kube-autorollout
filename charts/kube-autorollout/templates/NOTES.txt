### Good to know
- kube-autorollout runs as a controller and continuously watches your cluster
  for deployments/statefulsets/daemonsets configured for automated rollouts.
- kube-autorollout scans within the namespace it was deployed in;
  deploy this application in multiple names in case you want to automate rollouts in multiple namespaces
- No ingress is exposed, since this service runs internally within the cluster.

### Verifying rollouts
You can check that rollouts are being triggered by inspecting the events stream:
  kubectl get events -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

Or by describing a deployment you expect to be updated:
  kubectl describe deployment <your-deployment> -n <your-namespace>
